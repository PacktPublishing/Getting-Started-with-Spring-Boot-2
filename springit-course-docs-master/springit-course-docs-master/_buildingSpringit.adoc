This section of the documentation is going to contain details about each section of the course as we begin to build out our Reddit clone. In
each of these sections I will provide information, code or even links to topics that we discuss as we start to develop our application. Each
section underneath Building Springit represents a section in the course from here on out. So if you're working on the Service Layer section,
click on the Service Layer sub section here to find all of the accompanying documentation.
