=== About
This course offers hands-on experience building Spring Framework applications using Spring Boot. The first thing that is going to stand out is that we are going to move away from the boring, non-useful demos. In the new course, we are going to build a practical application from start to finish. This will allow you to see the process I use for building applications from idea to launch.

One of the big thing I heard from my students in my first course is that they wanted more information on how to go into production. A great application isnâ€™t that useful if we can deploy it into a production environment. We will take a look at using one of the most popular cloud services around, Amazon Web Services (AWS). On completion, students will have the foundation they need to build enterprise-ready Java applications.
