== Join our Community

We have started a brand new community for Spring Boot Developers. I want to invite all of you to a new private
Facebook community that I recently started. This is a place for developers to talk about projects that they are
working on, share new tips and tricks and even get help with problems that they are running into in their day to day
development. I will be sharing some of my favorite books, courses and tutorials that will help you sharpen your
Spring Development skills. This should be a fun place for all of us to hang out, so head on over and sign up.
I canâ€™t wait to chat with you!
